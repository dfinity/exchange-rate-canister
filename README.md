## Overview
The exchange rate canister provides an oracle service for cryptocurrency and
fiat currency exchange rates.
It interacts with all data sources using the
[HTTPS outcalls](https://internetcomputer.org/https-outcalls/) feature.


## Usage

The exchange rate canister offers a single endpoint:

```
"get_exchange_rate": (GetExchangeRateRequest) -> (GetExchangeRateResult)
```
The request must specify the base and quote assets and, optionally, a timestamp.
The returned result contains either the exchange rate for the requested asset pair
along with some metadata or an error.
Details can be found in the [Candid file](src/xrc/xrc.did).

> **_NOTE:_** 10B cycles must be sent to the exchange rate canister with each request.
A certain amount may be refunded depending on the number of required HTTPs outcalls
to serve the request. The base fee is 200M cycles.

## Official build
The official build should ideally be reproducible, so that independent parties
can validate that the correct WebAssembly module was deployed.

A dockerized build environment is used to build the WebAssembly module and
print its SHA-256 hash.

```bash
export IP_SUPPORT=ipv4
./scripts/docker-build
sha256sum xrc.wasm
```

The canister ID of the deployed exchange rate canister is `uf6dk-hyaaa-aaaaq-qaaaq-cai`.
